We will adopt the GitHub flow for branching and merging in our repository, ensuring a structured approach to collaborative development and version management.
### 6.2 Deployment:
Our application will be deployed using Docker containers, allowing for seamless deployment across different environments while ensuring consistent runtime environments and dependencies.
### 6.3 Data Population:
Initial data seeding will be performed using a script to populate the database with a curated selection of recipes. Subsequently, users will contribute additional recipes through an intuitive submission interface.
### 6.4 Testing:
We will utilize PyTest for comprehensive unit testing of backend functionality and Postman for API endpoint testing, ensuring robustness and reliability across different components of our application.
