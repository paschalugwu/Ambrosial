# Ambrosial Flask Application - Forms and Validation

This is a simple Flask application named 'Ambrosial'. It consists of several HTML templates, a CSS file for styling, and Python scripts for backend logic.

## Application Structure

The application is structured as follows:

- `flask_ambrosial.py`: This is the main Python script that runs the Flask application. It defines the routes for the application and the logic for each route.

- `forms.py`: This Python script defines the forms used in the application, including the registration and login forms.

- `main.css`: This is the CSS file that contains the styles for the application.

- HTML Templates: The application uses several HTML templates, all of which extend a base layout. These templates include:
    - `layout.html`: This is the base layout for the application. All other templates extend this layout.
    - `home.html`: This template displays the home page of the application, which includes a list of posts.
    - `about.html`: This template displays the about page of the application.
    - `login.html`: This template displays the login form.
    - `register.html`: This template displays the registration form.

## How the Components Interact

When a user navigates to a route in the application, the corresponding function in `flask_ambrosial.py` is executed. This function may render a template, which will be filled with any necessary data and sent back to the user's browser.

For example, when a user navigates to the home page, the `home()` function is executed. This function renders the `home.html` template and passes in a list of posts. The `home.html` template extends the `layout.html` template, so the final HTML sent to the user's browser includes the content from both templates.

The `home.html` and `about.html` templates both use the `{% block content %}` tag to specify where in the `layout.html` template they should be inserted.

The `login.html` and `register.html` templates both use forms defined in `forms.py`. When a user submits one of these forms, the corresponding function in `flask_ambrosial.py` validates the form data and either redirects the user or re-renders the form with error messages.

The `main.css` file contains styles that are applied to the HTML sent to the user's browser. This file is linked in the `layout.html` template, so its styles are applied to all pages in the application.
